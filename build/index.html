Many bloggers are now compiling lists of the best products and top remedies in various categories! Right now, I want to recommend a product called IBC (Innovation Body Cleansing) from Smart Life! It's a super useful and unique product aimed at purification, detoxification, removal of slags, dyes, preservatives (our food is overloaded with them), and toxins!!! It cleanses both the walls of the intestines (which no detox does) and the blood vessels while lowering cholesterol! And now, attention!!!! DOES NOT DISRUPT THE MICROFLORA!!!! It only improves and enriches with beneficial bacteria!! And all this with an absolutely natural composition, without chemicals, preservatives, dyes, and sugar!! So, this is definitely the product that should top your charts!! Thank you, @smartlifebio, for caring about us!</p>

                    <div class="swiper-slide-text">
                      <p>Exactly a month ago, I started taking the AFC concentrate from @smartlifebio, the decision to try it was not random. Upcoming long races, limited time for recovery, fatigue. Each of these moments can disable or spoil the result of any athlete.</p>

                      <p>Exactly a month ago, I started taking the AFC concentrate from @smartlifebio, the decision to try it was not random. Upcoming long races, limited time for recovery, fatigue. Each of these moments can disable or spoil the result of any athlete.</p>
                      <p>This month, I participated in a half marathon, a marathon, and two runs of over 50 km, plus the standard training process, resulting in a monthly volume of over 400 kilometers.</p>
                      <p>What changes?</p>
                      <p>· A clear reduction in heart rate during similar loads in training and during recovery;</p>
                      <p>· Normalization of hemoglobin levels (based on a complete blood count);</p>
                      <p>· Stress resistance;</p>
                      <p>· Normalization of sleep...</p>
                      <p>These are just a few positive factors...</p>
                      <p>Of the three flavor options, I liked chocolate and strawberry, but mint was extremely unpleasant, especially on an empty stomach in the morning. But, as they say, to each his own...</p>
                      <p>Maybe you'll like it?!</p>
                      <p>The AFC preparation has adapted me to challenging conditions, helped achieve high and comfortable results.</p>
                      <p>Many well-known people recommend this proven product, and I also recommend trying it to improve your sports and physiological indicators.</p>

Of course, we don't often think about how hard it is for our intestines and the digestive system in general!! For those with incorrect and irregular eating habits, fast food and convenience foods, and, let's face it, for those of us who are gearing up for holidays and feasts soon, raise your hand?!!! Uh-huh, a good half of humanity!!! And why do we all associate the concept of cleansing and detoxification with constant runs to the bathroom??? It's all not right! Meet IBC, the detox of a new generation! Yes, it has a huge range of applications and effects! I highly recommend it to those who want to fit into a dress and to those who want the holidays to pass unnoticed for the body as a whole!! And, in general, a constant new resident of my medicine cabinet!</p>

                          <p>Now, the trend is a proper diet. Everyone pays attention to the quality of products. But somehow, everyone forgets about their digestion and how important it is to monitor its proper functioning. After all, the health of the body and that same proper

                              time accompanied by nightmares and constant fatigue. In Italy, it's called the "Tour syndrome," and psychologists work with Tour finishers. I pulled myself together, slept a lot, went for massages and drips, and also, on the advice of @michaeldolgy,
                              took a month-long course of AFC concentrate @smartlifebio, which increases performance. The concentrate, plus motivation and the effect of self-hypnosis, helped me get into the training routine and run 25-30 km per day a month after the Tour.
                              Every morning, I drank the concentrate and felt a surge of strength and energy. This doping without doping helped me win a 2-week ultramarathon at @fitnessmania_mdm, and I can recommend it to anyone who is tired, experiencing a loss of strength,
                              and unwilling to move in anticipation of winter.</p>

                            be explained - VITAMIN DEFICIENCY! And if nothing is done, the condition will only worsen. Children will start wearing twos, crying to go to kindergarten or school, adults will hate everything around them in the morning, and after lunch, they will
                            fall into a stupor.</p>
                        <p>A year and a half ago, my mom's doctor recommended starting to take strong vitamins before the operation to strengthen the body's resistance during rehabilitation. It was then that these black bottles with AFC concentrate first came into our hands.</p>
                        <p>My mom and I started taking it two weeks before the operation. What do I want to say?</p>
                        <p>The drug is a natural concentrate without a single chemical element. It is approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and to this day, after clinical trials (not based on subjective customer reviews), it is the best means to raise
                            hemoglobin and lower cholesterol in the blood. Just after two weeks of use, confidently take tests, and your doctor will be amazed. Guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>No vitamin complex will give you better results in such a short period.</p>
                        <p>I can say for sure that I wake up easily and feel excellent vitality.</p>
                        <p>Mom received the results of preoperative tests. Well, what? Ready for space travel, they said!</p>
                        <p>Allowed for children from 7 years old to improve performance and concentration.</p>
                        <p>Look at how many famous athletes recommend this drug. And I recommend it too 💯</p>

                        <p>You often ask about vitamins and supplements that increase efficiency, boost immunity, improve sleep quality...</p>
                        <p>All these properties are possessed by this little jar!</p>
                        <p>The concentrate that increases efficiency, "afc," is 16 natural components specially selected into one complex for a powerful synergistic effect.</p>
                        <p>But I ordered it for another important function. It raises hemoglobin in the blood due to organic iron. And for me, it's a problem after a C-section because I was discharged from the maternity hospital with critically low hemoglobin levels.</p>
                        <p>Pasha also takes it because intense workouts, mental activity, and lack of sleep (he's a young dad after all) take their toll.</p>
                        <p>In short, the main properties of the AFC concentrate:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- frequent headaches disappear</li>
                            <li>- increases hemoglobin (verified by clinical blood analysis)</li>
                            <li>- replenishes iodine (in chelated form in the concentrate, absorbed by 95%, chemical iodine only by 5-10%)</li>
                            <li>- improves skin color</li>
                            <li>- hair growth, reduction of hair loss</li>
                            <li>- strengthens nails</li>
                            <li>- restores biorhythms, helps with insomnia</li>
                            <li>- freshness in the morning and energy throughout the day</li>
                            <li>- improves mood, stress resistance</li>
                            <li>- increases metabolism</li>
                            <li>- normalizes intestinal function</li>
                            <li>- endurance in workouts, increases motivation for training</li>
                            <li>- reduces heart rate❤️ during workouts under load and during recovery after exertion!</li>

                            the intestines (no detox does this) and the blood vessels, and lowers cholesterol! And now, attention!!!! DOES NOT DISRUPT THE MICROFLORA!!!! It only improves and enriches with beneficial bacteria!! And all this with an absolutely natural
                            composition, without chemicals, preservatives, dyes, and sugar!! So this is definitely the product that should be at the top of your charts!! Thanks to @smartlifebio for caring about us!</p>

                          <p>This month, I participated in a half marathon, a marathon, and two runs over 50 km, plus the standard training process, resulting in a monthly volume of over 400 kilometers.</p>
                          <p>What changes?</p>
                          <p>· A clear reduction in heart rate under similar loads in training and during recovery;</p>

                          <p>Of the three taste options of the preparation, I liked chocolate and strawberry, but mint was extremely unpleasant and did not "go down" on an empty stomach in the morning. But, as they say: to each his own...</p>

Of course, we don't often think about how hard it is for our intestines and the digestive system in general!! For those with improper and irregular eating habits, fast food, and semi-finished products, and for those who have upcoming holidays and feasts, raise your hand?!!! Well, that's a good half of humanity!!! And why do we all associate the concept of cleansing and detoxification with constant running to the bathroom??? That's not it at all! Meet IBC, the detox of a new generation! Yes, it has a huge range of applications and effects! I highly recommend it, whether you want to fit into a dress or just want the holidays to pass unnoticed for your body in general!! And overall, a constant new resident in my medicine cabinet!</p>

                          <p>Now, everyone is into healthy eating, but for some reason, everyone forgets about their digestion and how important it is to ensure its proper functioning. Because health begins with the digestive system and that very healthy eating. All the nastiness settles in our intestines - on its walls, thereby clogging it so much that the absorption of vitamins and minerals decreases by 5 times. And what happens to the microflora is scary to even think about. <b>Enter sorbents to the rescue. And don't forget that not all sorbents are created equal.</b></p>
                          <p><b>Progress is moving forward! And hooray! An amazing sorbent of a new generation @smartlifebio has appeared with the perfect composition and amazing detoxification.</b> It has such a huge range of effects that complete cleansing and restoration are guaranteed 100% ❤️ I'll just say that it improves the microflora and promotes the production of beneficial bacteria.

                          <p>Running can fill emptiness or create it. I encountered a feeling of emptiness after running for the first time last year when I ran 775 km in 16 days on the Camino de Santiago. This year, after the Tour of Giants, I felt the same emptiness, only this time it was accompanied by nightmares and constant fatigue. In Italy, this is called the "Tour syndrome," and psychologists work with Tour finishers. I pulled myself out, slept a lot, had massages and drips, and also, on the advice of @michaeldolgy, took a month's course of AFC concentrate @smartlifebio, which increases performance. The concentrate, plus motivation and the effect of self-hypnosis, helped me get into a training routine and run 25-30 km per day a month after the Tour. Every morning I drank the concentrate and felt a surge of strength and energy. This doping without doping helped me win a 2-week ultramarathon at @fitnessmania_mdm, and I can recommend it to everyone who is tired, experiences a loss of strength, and unwillingness to move on the eve of winter.</p>

                        <p>The most dangerous period when you can catch a virus is the offseason: spring and autumn. During this time, adults and children start getting sick more often, efficiency decreases, mood worsens, and the desire to leave the house diminishes. This is easily explained - VITAMIN DEFICIENCY! And if nothing is done, the condition will only worsen. Children will start wearing glasses, crying going to kindergarten or school, adults will hate everything around them in the morning, and after lunch, they will start falling asleep.</p>
                        <p>A year and a half ago, my mother's doctor advised her to start taking strong vitamins before surgery to strengthen the body's resistance during rehabilitation. It was then that these black bottles with AFC concentrate first came into our hands.</p>
                        <p>My mom and I started taking it two weeks before the operation. What do I want to say?</p>
                        <p>The drug is a natural concentrate without a single chemical element. It is approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, and to this day, after clinical trials (not based on subjective customer reviews), it is the best means to increase hemoglobin and reduce cholesterol in the blood. Just after two weeks of use, confidently take tests, and your doctor will be amazed. Guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>No vitamin complex will give you better results in such a short time.</p>
                        <p>I can definitely say that I wake up easily, and I feel excellent vigor.</p>
                        <p>Mom received the results of preoperative tests. Well, what? Ready to go to space, they said!</p>
                        <p>Allowed for children from 7 years old to improve performance and concentration.</p>
                        <p>Look at how many famous athletes recommend this drug. And I also recommend it 💯</p>

                      <p>Many of you often ask about vitamins and supplements that increase efficiency, boost immunity, improve sleep quality....</p>
                      <p>All these properties are possessed by this little jar!</p>
                      <p>Concentrate that increases efficiency "afc" is 16 natural components specially selected into one complex for a powerful synergistic effect.</p>
                      <p>But, I ordered it because of another important function. It raises hemoglobin in the blood due to organic iron. And for me, it's a problem after a C-section because I was discharged from the maternity hospital with critically low hemoglobin levels.</p>
                      <p>Pasha also takes it because intense workouts, mental activity, and lack of sleep (being a young dad after all) take their toll.</p>
                      <p>A brief overview of the main properties of the AFC concentrate:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>- Frequent headaches are gone</li>
                          <li>- Increases hemoglobin (verified by clinical blood analysis)</li>
                          <li>- Iodine replenishment (in chelated form in the concentrate, absorbed by 95%, chemical iodine only by 5-10%)</li>
                          <li>- Improves skin color</li>
                          <li>- Hair growth, reduction of hair loss</li>
                          <li>- Nail strengthening</li>
                          <li>- Restores biorhythms, helps with insomnia</li>
                          <li>- Freshness in the morning and energy throughout the day</li>
                          <li>- Improves mood, stress resistance</li>
                          <li>- Increases metabolism</li>
                          <li>- Normalizes intestinal function</li>
                          <li>- Endurance in training, increased motivation for workouts</li>
                          <li>- Reduces heart rate❤️ during workouts under load and during recovery after exercise!</li>

Starting to take it in the mornings, my mood changed, dealing with stressful situations at work became much easier, and morning lifts became easy. In a month, I also noticed that my hair was falling out less, nails were growing faster and became stronger, headaches stopped, although they were quite frequent before.

                      <p>Many often ask me how I manage everything, whether I sleep at all, and where I get the strength - there have been various situations: I got tired, slept poorly, and the sleep schedule was disrupted due to flights(</p>

                      <p>The AFC concentrate contains exclusively NATURAL ingredients, and what's good - no caffeine, dyes, sugar, gluten, and preservatives. Absolutely organic and HARMLESS, which means it is suitable even for schoolchildren.</p>

                      <p>I recommend it to EVERYONE who leads an active lifestyle, lives in a busy schedule, experiences stress, prepares for exams, fights with lack of sleep, and just wants to strengthen the immune system.</p>

I have even more energy, workouts go much better, my pulse recovers much faster after exertion, endurance has increased, even though I'm working 24/7 - marathon, work, shootings, kids. It is made from 16 natural components; you know I'm all about natural products, so I decided to give it a try!</p>
                      <p>By the way, the manufacturer says that it normalizes reduced hemoglobin because it contains organic iron. I personally haven't checked because mine has always been normal. What else pleased me is the presence of iodine; our thyroid needs it for the normal functioning of the entire hormonal system and metabolism.</p>
